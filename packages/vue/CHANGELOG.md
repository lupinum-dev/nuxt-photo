# @lupinum/vue-photo

## 1.0.0-rc.0

### Major Changes

- [#36](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/36) [`d93238b`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/d93238bec66ed1d33d687d165c9bfa9a0c5f71bc) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Replace the prerelease Embla integration with stable Embla 8.6 and its documented public methods. `PhotoCarousel` now accepts direct `loop`, `dragFree`, and `direction` props. Remove the `options` bag, `slidesToScroll`, and the private snap-model integration. Carousel lightboxes remain opt-in.

- [#36](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/36) [`d93238b`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/d93238bec66ed1d33d687d165c9bfa9a0c5f71bc) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Finalize the 1.0 lightbox contract. Rename `useLightboxProvider()` to `provideLightbox()` and `LightboxDefaults` to `PhotoDefaults` without compatibility aliases. Export `LightboxHandle` and expose it only from `PhotoAlbum` and `PhotoGroup`. Transition props now rebuild from immutable defaults when changed or cleared, and live reduced-motion changes flow through animation timing.

### Minor Changes

- [#36](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/36) [`d93238b`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/d93238bec66ed1d33d687d165c9bfa9a0c5f71bc) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Accessibility and direction: localized controls, native trigger buttons, RTL support, complete keyboard map

  **Every built-in label is centralized and localizable.** Missing values fall back to a frozen English label set, including polite slide announcements. Custom primitive compositions can read the complete active set with `usePhotoLabels()`.

  **PhotoTrigger renders a native `<button>`** instead of a `div` with `role="button"`. Focus, activation, and screen-reader semantics are now native. The element carries an `np-trigger` class with UA chrome reset, so slotted thumbnails style as before. Consumer CSS that styled the trigger via element selectors (`div`) must switch to class selectors.

  **Right-to-left layouts are supported.** All shipped CSS uses logical properties (`inset-inline`, `margin-inline-start`, `text-align: start`), so lightbox chrome, carousel arrows, counters, and captions mirror correctly under `dir="rtl"`.

  **Keyboard map completed**: `Home` and `End` jump to the first and last photo, joining `Escape`, arrow keys, and `z`. The full map is documented on the lightbox behavior page. The built-in counter region is now `aria-live="polite"` so slide changes are announced.

- [#36](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/36) [`d93238b`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/d93238bec66ed1d33d687d165c9bfa9a0c5f71bc) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Add optional `placeholderSrc` previews to `PhotoItem` and `ImageSource`. Placeholders reset whenever the adapter-resolved URL changes and remain visible after load failures. `PhotoAlbum.sizes` now also accepts a native HTML sizes string for every layout.

### Patch Changes

- [#36](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/36) [`d93238b`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/d93238bec66ed1d33d687d165c9bfa9a0c5f71bc) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Container-query rendering correctness

  Setting `defaultContainerWidth` together with `breakpoints` on `<PhotoAlbum>` no longer emits a dead `@container` stylesheet. Inline calc widths are authoritative when `defaultContainerWidth` is set; the container-query path now renders only when it can actually own the layout (breakpoints without `defaultContainerWidth`). Albums relying on the old dual emission need no change — the inline widths they rendered are unchanged.

  Container-query spans now use exact range syntax such as `width < 800px`. Integer, fractional, and subpixel breakpoints meet at the same exclusive boundary without subtractive offsets or uncovered gaps.

  An empty rows layout at every breakpoint now logs one dev-time warning instead of silently rendering unsized items.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/pull/20) [`f9149eb`](https://github.com/lupinum-dev/nuxt-photo/commit/f9149eb6d4aae5f26ab27a1a2e533fead1d790f3) Thanks [@Mat4m0](https://github.com/Mat4m0)! - Clarify the package status in the npm README.

## 0.2.0

### Breaking

- `LightboxRoot` now owns the FLIP transition visual. Custom lightboxes must
  remove `LightboxGhostImage` and `mediaOpacity` slot bindings.
- Replaced `--np-backdrop-blur` with `--np-backdrop-filter`.
- Photo IDs are required non-empty strings, and public photo and controller
  models are readonly.
- Removed `PhotoMapper`, `itemMapper`, `photoId`, object-identity opening,
  `openPhoto`, raw Embla options and plugins, and duplicate album layout props.
- `PhotoGroup` now requires one explicit `photos` collection.
- Carousel and autoplay props now use library-owned option types.
- Provider configuration is setup-time and requires a remount to change.
- Raised the Node.js 22 support floor to 22.18 and defined Node 24 as the
  maintainer runtime.

### Changed

- Replaced reactive ghost-image choreography with one WAAPI motion controller.
- Limited initial lightbox media mounting to active and adjacent slides.
- Centralized lifecycle intent, abortable transitions, modal and body-scroll
  ownership, gesture sessions, and pan and zoom orchestration.
- Derived carousel controls from Embla's geometry-dependent snap registry.
- Added structured validation at public photo boundaries.
- Ensured that only one lightbox owns focus and page isolation at a time.

### Removed

- Removed the framework-free engine package, compatibility paths, automatic
  `PhotoGroup` collection, public vendor types, private helper exports, and
  obsolete test scaffolding.

### Fixed

- Prevented responsive thumbnail-to-slide handoffs from briefly darkening.
- Fixed lifecycle interruption, stale intent, and cross-provider modal races.
- Fixed group registration ordering and carousel snap mismatches.
- Fixed rejected lifecycle promises in built-in interactions.
- Fixed package export condition ordering so TypeScript declarations resolve
  before JavaScript imports.

## 0.1.2

### Added

- Added the `useLightboxProvider`-first customization path for advanced
  lightbox interfaces.
- Added MIT license metadata and packed-package verification.

### Changed

- Moved advanced customization to the root Vue package entrypoint.
- Split photo-album rendering into dedicated rows, SSR snapshot, fallback, and
  mounted layout views.
- Defined package root entrypoints as the supported public surface.
- Raised the Node.js support floor to match the Nuxt 4 toolchain.
- Updated the Embla integration to the `9.0.0-rc02` release line.

### Removed

- Removed `@lupinum/vue-photo/extend`.
- Removed injected lightbox slot-override plumbing in favor of root exports and
  global lightbox component overrides.

### Fixed

- Fixed image decode failure handling and active-photo preservation.
- Fixed body-scroll ownership and missing `openById` behavior.
- Fixed invalid columns and masonry inputs.
- Added an accessible name to the built-in lightbox dialog.

## 0.0.1

- Initial public preview of the Vue photo components, composables, layouts,
  lightbox primitives, and styles.
